      <!-- About Me -->
      <section id="about" class="about">
        <h3 class="main-section-about">About</h3>
        <p class="text small-txt">My name is Paul Calabrese. I relocated to Seattle from Denver with my girlfriend about a year and a half ago. It was easily one of the hardest things that I've had to do as I never saw myself leaving Denver and I was leaving a lot of friends behind - friends whom I had met since living in Denver and friends from the east coast whom had moved to Denver as well. Both of us felt stuck and unfulfilled in our respective careers, so looking for more we packed our cars to the brim and headed Northwest.</p>
        <p class="text small-txt"> Once we arrived in Seattle, I started soul searching as to what I wanted to do with my life. I should say that I continued soul searching as that is largely what inspired the move to begin with. So I continued soul searching, "what can I do as a career that is intrinsictly fulfilling and realistic?" It seemed that these two characteristics were at war with each other. I could be a lawyer or an accountant and make a living, but the bad fit would make me miserable. The opposite option seemed to be more along the lines of being a starving artist type. I mean I could join Arcade Fire or The Wu-Tang Clan, but something tells me that they aren't hiring at the moment.</p>
        <p class="text small-txt">I've wanted to be a Front-end Developer since right after college when I saw some of the cool projects that my old roommate was working on. He was a graphics design major and a very talented artist, I was an English major and knew nothing about design. I assumed that since he was an artist and took a typical four year college path, that this was the normal path that one takes to become a web developer. I felt regretful that I didn't take this path in school - but I also knew that I couldn't afford the time or money that a four year degree requires.</p>
        <p class="text small-txt">That is, I felt regretful until I talked to an advisor from my alma mater who told me that I didn't need a degree to pursue this, I just needed the skills. After talking to another friend who made a similar career change towards Web Development, he said if he had to do it again that he would go to a bootcamp. This is the first time that I've heard anything about coding bootcamps. If I had known its something that I would have pursued years ago. Finally knowing what I wanted to do with my life at the tender age of 29, I began immersing myself in learning to code.</p>

      <section id="resources" class="resources">
        <h3 class="main-section-resources">Resources</h3>
        <p class="text">The main resources that I have used in my coding education consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="text resource-ul-li">Treehouse</li>
          <p class="text small-txt resource-p">I started teaching myself via Team Treehouse. Treehouse was a very good introduction to everything that I needed to learn. The Front-end path gave me some starting experience in:</p>
          <ul class="text small-txt resource-ul">
            <li>html</li>
            <li>css</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>Git/Github</li>
            <li>SASS</li>
          </ul>
          <li class="text resource-ul-li">Codefellows</li>
          <p class="text small-txt resource-p">I then took 101 and 202 level classes with Code Fellows to solidify my knowledge and get some feedback and mentorship in a more traditional classroom setting. I received a 90% and above in both classes and got pretty good at html and css, but lacked substainally in JavaScript, which was not not substainially covered at the 101 and 202 levels.</p>
          <li class="text resource-ul-li">Free Code Camp</li>
          <p class="text small-txt resource-p">I stumbled across Free Code Camp, and decided to use that as a resource to take my next step forward. I have recently completed the Basic Front-end projects and am working my way through the intermediate algorithms and projects.</p>
          <li class="text resource-ul-li">Podcasts: Shoptalk Show, Code Newbie, How to Hold a Pencil</li>
          <p class="text small-txt resource-p">Podcasts allowed me to build on my knowledge on the weekdays during times when I was unable to actually sit down and code such as lunch breaks at work and during my commute. I have found 'Code Newbie' and 'How to Hold a Pencil' encouraging by hearing stories of people who have successfully completed what I am trying to accomplish.Shoptalk was also helpful in finding my approach on a large scope("Just Build Websites!")and how to approach individual tasks. Shoptalk was also very good because it discussed different elements that I had not learned yet. So I knew terms such as 'boilerplate' or 'bootstrap' before I even had a chance to play with them.</p>

            <p class="text small-txt">After I completed the Front-end Development path on Treehouse, I began to play with making static sites that required me to play with html and css outside of the scope of the treehouse course. This is a site that I created for one of my friend's sister who makes jewlery as a hobby.</p>

            <p class="text small-txt">After I made the pomodoro clock I realized that I could use a similar approach to make an MPC, which is the instrument used to sample.I am a very big fan of sample based hip hop fan, so this very much appealed to me.

      <section id="future" class="goals">
        <h3 class="main-section-goals">GA &amp; My Goals</h3>
        <p class="text small-txt">I have learned a lot since a year and a half ago when I did not even know how to put text onto a page. I have immersed myself as much as possible while having a full time job by coding on nights and weekends and listening to podcasts when I could not code. The next step is quitting my job and committing full time to learn in a fully immersive enviornment.</p>
        <p class="text small-txt">What I am looking for in General Assembly is to take me to the next level in my career transition. I believe that with my current skills I could maybe land a job IF I got lucky enough in finding the right position and employer, but I don't want to take that step with the bare minimum skills. If I am going to do this, I want to have a really good foundation and become a real developer. I need to solidify my JavaScript skills in the same way that the Code Fellows courses solidified my CSS abilities. I also need to learn the JavaScript frameworks(React, Node, Angular) that employers are looking for. Even though I do not intend on becoming much of a Back-end Developer, I know that it can be important to know how the back-end works in order to collaborate with the other dev's that I would work with.It would also be nice to be able to create a full site if I wanted to.</p>
